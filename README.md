Project Summary:
The project leverages Google AI Studio's Gemini-2.0-Flash model and FastAPI to create a robust and efficient API service 
for validating and processing residency permits and related documents. Users can upload images of residency permits,
which the system maps and verifies using advanced AI capabilities. The project enables accurate extraction of critical information 
(e.g., ID number, expiry date, nationality, and other details) in JSON format. It also incorporates seamless API key integration
to ensure secure and scalable operations, making it a practical solution for residency document verification workflows.
